# 202112_gifts_list
This repo will be useful to send emails to my friends for Christmas 2021.

Based on a list of users, this code creates a list of random pairs for (gift buyer, gift recipient).
Based on this list, each user receive an email with the indication of who will be the recipient of the gift. The other users will not know the other pairs until the party day.
